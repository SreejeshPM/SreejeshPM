- 🚀 Hey there, I'm @SreejeshPM, your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast! 🤓 I'm still fueled by curiosity and forever on the learning journey, eager to cook up something amazing in the world of data. 😎

- 📺 I've got this little gem of a YouTube channel [https://youtube.com/@coffee_n_code], where I take complex data concepts and make them as easy as brewing your morning coffee. ☕ You can find all the notebooks I use for these adventures under 'Youtube_codebase'.

- 👁️ What really catches my eye? Language models, text analysis, and the mystical world of number crunching that follows in the footsteps of machine learning. 📊

- 💼 Currently, I'm donning the hat of a lead data scientist at a prominent insurance company, where I'm weaving data magic. 🪄

- 🤝 I'm all ears for exciting collaborations in the realm of data science and machine learning. But hey, I'm not picky – if your project revolves around data, I'm your go-to guy! 🌐

- 💌 How can you get in touch? Well, I'm virtually everywhere, but I have a soft spot for good old emails. Drop a line to sreejeshpmohanan@gmail.com, and I'll get back to you faster than you can say "data-driven." 😉 (P.S. Make the subject line interesting, please!)
